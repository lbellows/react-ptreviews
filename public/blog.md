# Homemade Fat Burning Stack
#### *02.22.2010*

Hello Readers!  I wanted to share my fat burning stack with you because I've started it up in prep for the summer. A couple things to note: I'm only mentioning legal supps here. Ephedrine HCL is a great addition at 25mg 2x per day but I wont make that part of my crucial stack.  If you want to add it, go to a local pharmacy and ask for it at the counter.  They will ask for your ID and it may be logged in a central database somewhere.  Don't worry if you don't plan to commit any felonies in the future :)
 
Anyway, here are my vital fat burning supps, each one is taken 2-3 times per day:
 
- [ECGC Green Tea Extract @ 800mg](http://amzn.to/2yzQhXq)
- [Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR) @ 1000mg](http://amzn.to/2iSv5Ft)
- [Caffeine Anhydrous @ 200mg](http://amzn.to/2yxnoej)
- [Yohimbine HCL @ 5mg](http://amzn.to/2yy0yn0)
 
This is a dose you may want to work up to, especially if you have a low tolerance to drugs.  Start with half of what is listed taken 1-2 times per day, and go up from there.  Make sure to take with a meal, especially at first, as it can cause some havoc on your stomach.

The information in that link will provide your friend will meal and snack ideas that could be used when preparing meals when eating AF-Method-style.

Additionally, here is a list of staple ingredients I tend to purchase at the [grocery store](http://amzn.to/2AGVqOD) on a weekly basis (rotated week to week -- some weeks fish, some weeks chicken, etc. I don't buy this EVERY trip to the store, duh).
Food Ideas and Groceries:

Here is my take on the AF Method:
Caloric & Macronutrient Intake:
- When it comes to reaching your fitness goals, diet plays a large role because the energy we eat ultimately determines if we are adding mass to our bodies or helping the body to shed excess mass (fat loss).
- If your overall goal(s) include fat loss, then it is important that each day your body sees a “calorie deficit”, meaning the number of calories you consume must be less than the number of calories you expend (or use).
- If your overall goal(s) include adding lean body mass (muscle), then it is important to eat the right types of foods in order to sustain your energy levels as well as feed the body the needed amino acids to build up proteins for muscle. Obviously, if one desired major muscle gain, then consumption of these foods in mass quantities would also be needed, since the greater amount of protein and calories eaten will help a person to add on even more body mass (some of which will be fat and some of which will be muscle).
- If your overall goal is body fat loss combined with lean body mass gains, you are working with a delicate balance. Daily, these are your eating goals:
- Eat within 2 hours of waking. If it’s a morning where you are training, eat within 1 hour of training.
- After your first meal, space meals and snacks 2-3 hours apart, keeping in mind that you need to be sure you are within your calorie limits by the end of the day.
- To determine the number of calories you should be eating per day, do the following:
  - Multiply your body weight by 10. This is the MINIMUM number of calories you need to eat each day.
  - Multiply your body weight by 11. This is the MAXIMUM number of calories you should eat each day.
  - With these two calculations, you now have a range to work with. Some days you will be closer to the bottom number; other days you will be closer to the higher number. For example, for a 170 lb woman, the MINIMUM calories would be 1700 and the MAXIMUM calories would be 1870. This would give her approximately 170-calories of leeway, giving her more flexibility in her eating each day.
- The macronutrient balance in your foods should focus on protein, carbohydrates and fats. At times, (sugar) alcohols may be consumed, and this nutrient will an imbalance in your nutrition for the day, so it is important to keep these treats to a minimum.

SPECIAL NOTE: For men, caloric intake for the AF Method (if he seeks to lose body fat and gain LBM simultaneously) should be 13-14x his body weight in calories per day.

The IDEAL macronutrient ratio for a female (or male) aiming to lose body fat and gain lean muscle mass simultaneously breaks down like so:
- 40%-45% of daily calorie intake should come from protein
- 25%-30% of intake should come from carbohydrates
- 25%-30% of intake should come from healthy fats

In the initial stages of your new eating plan, the two single-most important actions you should take are
- Logging your food daily using FitDay - Free Weight Loss and Diet Journal and/or a food journal that calculate macronutrient ratios
- Once logging your food (or as you log it throughout the day), be sure to honor the CALORIE RANGE and eat strategically in order to create CORRECT MACRONUTRIENT BALANCES.

SPECIAL NOTE: Here is a link to my Sticky about "How to Use [Fitday.com](http://fitday.com)?"
How To Use Fitday.com to Log Foods
It doesn't address the new updates to Fitday from the last few months but it covers most other stuff.

Finally, here is the AF Method "Rules" in a nutshell:

Probably the MOST important thing for you to follow right now is the Anafit Method's "Carb Rules". This is CRITICAL. Everyone has carb-addictions -- sugared coffees, lowfat ice cream, real chocolate, etc. The body views many of these items, if not all, as empty calories... but if you must have it... place it at the right time of day. And hopefully -- we can cut it from 7 days a week.. down to maybe once a week on a "cheat day." This plan does not need to be an "ALL OR NOTHING" immediately. Set small goals week to week... and this program will work it's magic for you FOR GOOD!

Carb Rules via the Anafit Method

1) Do not eat carbohydrates before noon/lunchtime.

This means that your breakfast must consist of eggs, lean meats (like turkey sausage, chicken, etc.), protein shakes (whatever flavor you want if you want to look into buying a powder or a mix), and/or cheese/dairy. No fruit... no vegetables... no bread... no cereal. If you want ANY of those things -- simply have it at lunchtime.

WHY? Well, what actually makes people overweight is excess insulin in the body. Let me explain: I had a bad habit of eating 94% ff popcorn before bed. What happens is that I eat the popcorn at 9pm at night... and my body says, "Ooh carbs!" and changes it to glucose (the body's version of sugar) Anyway, in response to the glucose, the body will release insulin to balance the blood sugar. That is a GOOD thing... however, it will continue to release this insulin all night long until the glucose is gone. Well -- the body isn't active, right? You're inactive at night... and inactive in the morning before the day really gets going. SO that insulin is present for several hours. What people don't know: Excess insulin makes people overweight because your body will not burn fat while insulin is present in your blood. That's why high protein diets work so well... people eat nonstop... but their insulin release is so low, the weight comes off. However, their mistake is that more often than not... once the weight is gone... they go back to eating carbs all day long and all night long and the weight comes back on. SO -- stay away from the carbs until lunchtime. It is CRUCIAL.

2) Do not eat carbohydrates after dinnertime.

Same theory as the above. You can have carbs AT lunch... as a snack in the afternoon (twice even!) and you can have them AT dinner and as your dessert only if you eat it RIGHT with dinner. But after those dishes are done and put away -- no more carbs.

SPECIAL NOTE: The few grams of carbs lingering in sugar-free coffee creamer or 1T of milk in your coffee or the 3g in your protein powder are all trivial amounts and nothing that will totally derail you from the AF Method's rules. Simply keep your morning and evening carbs under 10g (1/2 a piece of fruit, max) to keep that insulin response at bay.

Recommended supplementation for the AF Method is (and always has been) Glucorell-R (at meals with carbs, in this case lunch and dinner) and Sesapure (3x/day at breakfast, lunch, and dinner). For women, it is especially important to add Yohimburn-ES to the body prior to cardio/weight training if fat and water loss is desired in the process too.

Good luck!

# Animalbolics - How 5-6 meals a day makes you fat!
#### 9.16.2009

That's right, and you read it here first. They make you fat.

After I proved the farce of the ketogenic diets I began to think, 'What type of diet was I on that made
me the leanest and put on the most mass!' Then one of the ketogenic diets authors sent me a nasty
email which said, 'What diet won't shut down your thyroid, genius.'

Well, if nothing else, he was at least smart enough to realize that those almighty diets do shut down
your thyroid. I felt pity for him because it was sad how he was still clinging to dreams of ketosis even
though he had been scammed. But realized there was hope for him when he called me 'genius'! He still
had the power of rational thinking left and I'd be damned if I didn't help this poor soul.

Hmmm. What diets don't shut down your thyroid? First, what do we know about how the thyroid shuts
down when dieting? There are 3 ways; lack of carbohydrate, heat (DNP and external) and DNP binding
to T4 protein and excreting it which is actually good, but that is another story. We aren't going to take
DNP so those two are out and we are left with lack of carbohydrates. We are also not going to take CLA
or pyruvate so we are left with a pure diet with no catches. How can we keep the carbs going? We all
know of one diet that won't shut things down and that is the 'Up and down' type diet. We eat normal one
day and lower our calories the next and repeat. This maintains all the hormones, but could take quite a
long time. We need a faster and possibly simpler way.

Why not eat 5-6 small meals a day? Because it makes you fat! Now we are going to use the ketogenic
authors arguments against them. Insulin does what? It drives glucose and needed nutrients into the
cells, including fat cells, AND it stops lipolysis!!!! It stops lipolysis!!!!! If I am eating 5-6 times a day I am
going to be stopping lipolysis every single time I eat again because I will get an insulin rise which, can
you all say it? Stops lipolysis!! You cannot burn fat if you are eating all day!

Now, I am back to thinking about when I was the leanest. About 5 years ago when I was finishing
college, but why? Because I only ate 1-2 meals a day! That's right and when you see the logic you will
see the light always and realize that another scam has been perpetuated upon all of us in order to cell
meal replacements. When did all these 5-6 meals a day really start to hit. When those meal
replacements became all the rage. Throw them out because you don't need them anymore!!

We will start our diet in the morning. The night before we replenished all our carbs before going to
sleep. It is morning and we wake up and our body is in what mode? Fat burning mode!!! The first thing
you usually learn is that if you want to burn the most fat off with aerobics you do it in the morning
before you eat. Since we are in fat burning mode why would we want to ruin it with food that would raise
insulin? And for what? What exercise are you going to do which you are going to need all that energy
for? Remember you are fully carbed from last night. If you are fully carbed up and you eat
carbohydrates then where are the carbs going? They can't go to muscle so they are going to FAT! Your
morning meal makes you fatter!! So what do we do? You most likely are going to sit in a car and go sit
in an office for 8 hours or so. The only thing which needs sugar is your brain and it doesn't need much.
To keep in and enhance the fat burning you are going to drink coffee and take an ephedrine or PPA and
add some yohimbine. The coffee suppresses blood sugar and the E and Y and PPA cause a release of
noradrenaline which is a potent fat burning hormone. If you get hungry you can have a protein drink,
but no sugar. Fructose goes to fat automatically and the protein keeps the glycogen level up which is
another fat burner. You don't want too much protein, though or that can go to sugar which is going to go
to fat, as well.

What do I do for lunch? You want to stay in fat burning mode right? First let's look at what others
recommend. Eat your largest meal at lunch! Absolutely and totally wrong. What happens about an hour
later. You are so tired from the insulin that you can hardly think and it takes all you can do to stay
awake. Not only that, but all the carbs you ate are going to fat! What did you do to deplete the liver or
muscle of carbs from the morning until now? NOTHING. You sat at your desk and maybe walked across
the street to buy lunch. Your muscles need nothing so it all goes to fat and you ruined your fat burning
as well with the insulin from the meal. You eat a light low glycemic high fat meal, like a salad for lunch
and have some more ECY and maybe another protein drink. 2 hours - 45 minutes before you are going
to work out you eat a low glycemic meal like oatmeal or an apple.

This is scientifically proven to improve performance and will help you burn more fat. You workout and
then you get to eat! Your muscles are primed for growth and now you want the insulin to be spiked so
you get more glucose and AA's into them. We also know that most if not all of the recovery substrates
need to be supplied to the muscle in a two hour window and then again before 6 hours.

Immediately after your workout you consume up to 400 calories in a glucose/protein drink. 2 hours later
you hit the damaged muscle again with your regular meal. Your muscles are now loaded with glucose
and protein and they are waiting for you to take some ghb and go to bed so they can get some GH.

That's it!. No BS. No pain. Look at it again. You are all carbed up. In the morning you are in or near
ketosis and you want to keep it there. Eating would ruin it so you don't eat and besides, the insulin and
carbs from the meal have nowhere to go so any calories would just go to fat. You don't do anything
strenuous in the morning so you don't eat a high carb lunch which keeps you in ketosis.

Eat a low glycemic meal 45 minutes before your workout. The time to eat and recover is AFTER you
have worked out and that is when and how you do it. Simple carbs and protein and then your meal.
Sleep. No expensive powders or pills or special foods. Can't get much simpler.


There are supplements and steps to follow to get the most out of your thyroid and liver, but that will be
later. If you have something to say about this being wrong then get some science to prove it or shut up.
Just as I had science to expose the fallacies of ketogenic diets, I also have all the science to back this
up.


The Science:

Study performed by Taylor and colleagues.

Following ingestion of a test meal consisting of cereal, skim milk, scrambled eggs, French toast, apple
juice, and a milk shake [200 g (60% or 800 calories) carbohydrate, 45 g (21% fat or 405 calories), 80 g
(19% or 320 calories) protein; 1,914 kcall] [The total calories and the breakdown of the intake is wrong
because my scanner screwed it up and I don't have the original] by healthy subjects, muscle glycogen
concentration did not start to rise until 1-2 hours after eating, and the increase was not statistically
significant until 3 hours after eating. Seven hours following the meal, plasma insulin levels were still
elevated threefold. Four hours following the meal, muscle glycogen began to fall, suggesting a flux of
excess carbon out of the muscle and into storage as triglycerides (fat).

Another argument for Animalobolics! I had been looking for this entry into my comp for 2 years and
though I don't have the entire study, that last line is significant. This was a mixed meal containing fat.
This is not what you want to do after a workout. Look how long it took glycogen levels in the muscle to
rise. 1-2 hours and it wasn't important until 3 hours. You need no fat and simple carbs with protein after
a workout. Seven hours following the meal, plasma insulin levels were still elevated threefold. Let's see,
you want to eat small meals all day, still? The point is that eating mixed meals gets your insulin up and
keeps it up for a long time. Hell, by 7 hours many would have eaten 2 more times and that would push
your insulin up even higher and longer. Remember, if insulin is present, fat burning is negative! The
magical last line!!! Four hours following the meal, muscle glycogen began to fall, suggesting a flux of
excess carbon out of the muscle and into storage as triglycerides (fat).

This is a main point of Animalobolics and why you only have carbs after your workout. Why? Because
you carbed up AFTER the workout when it is most important and any further influx of carbs is going to
leak out of a fully carbed up muscle and go to fat.

Again, I will give you the basics and most of you can figure out the rest. Base calorie should be figured
out at 10-12 x your wt in lbs. All caloric intake is worked out by going backwards from your post
workout meal. For that meal you take in 1g carbs for every 1k bodyweight. Now, you also take 1g whey
or soy protein for every 2.5g of carbs that you just figured out. Do this immediately and 1-2 hours later.
Subtract those numbers from your total caloric intake to see how much else you can eat for your other
meals.

200lb man x 12 = 2400 calories. 200/2.2 = 90KG.

90KG = 90g carbs after workout.

90/2.5 = 36g protein.

90g carbohydrates = 360 cal.

36g protein = 145 cal protein.

Total immediate intake is 505 calories.

If you do that regimen 1-2 hours later you will then have 1010calories.

2400 base - workout meals = 1390 calories left to eat for the next 24 hours. (Almost 3 Big Macs) and if
you can't make it through the day on those calories I don't know what to tell you) I'll tell you that with
all that protein it is hard to eat after those 2 postworkout meals.

ALL YOUR SUBSEQUENT MEALS ARE GOING TO BE NO GLYCEMIC MEALS! Except for 2-3 doses of
200calories worth of fruit for a total of 400-500calories in carbs to keep your liver converting T4-T3. 200
in the morning 100cal or so at lunch and 100-200 at 2hrs before your next workout. 1390 - 500 calories
leaves you with 890. If you are taking 1g protein per lb which I find very hard to do, that is 200g protein
and 800 calories. You already have taken in 72g protein for 288 calories. From morning until your next
workout you then need to get 128 g protein or 512 more calories in protein. That leaves you with only
378 calories in fat which is 42g. Just make sure you eat whey protein and eggs in the morning, then you
can eat chicken or tuna salad for lunch.
